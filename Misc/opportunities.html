<h1>How AI is advancing education in today's society.</h1>

</ul><h3><p>Learning in the classroom comes with many challenges for teachers and students. Currently most of the world is in covid-19 lockdown, forcing students to learn from home. This is the natural advantage with online-learning as it can be done from home and with the help of AI can effectively teach students.
</ul><h3><p>The accessability of devices for online learning in New zealand  is highly available. This is because most students have a device to study from and a internet connection. This has allowed students to continue their learning while the country was in lockdown.</p>
</ul><h3><p>With learning be online AI has helped teachers identify and detect student difficulties, this is a big advantage over traditional learning as it can pinpoint the often unnoticeable or neglected issues of their learning.</p>
</ul><h3><p> AI is a problem solver. With student difficulties recognized, AI can generate content for students on a learning platform. This content is generated to meet the requirements of the individual students needs. This has allowed students for a better learning experience. AI can also recognise what stage of learning of the concept they are at. This can help students who are out of place within the learning pathway, and get them back up to speed.</p> 
</ul><h3><p>Teachers are also benefiting from AI within education. With online-learning comes administrative tasks. These tasks can be automated by AI which were once normally painstaking and time-consuming. This is giving teachers more time to focus on the students for a better learning experience.</p>
</ul><h3><p>AI is also helping students off the learning platform, AI has improved research searching. This is done using prioritizing keywords and using multiple algorithms to find relevant topics, Examples of this is google scholar and its search engine.</p>
</ul><h3><p>With the learning being from home, many students benefit by not feeling the social pressure at school. Students are less vunerable to bullying although cyberbullying is still relevant among students.
