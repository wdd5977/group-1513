<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>I believe online-learning and AI is a benefit to society, but you cannot learn as effeciently without a tutor. The easiest way of learning from a tutor is face-to-face. Therefore I don't believe online-learning is the future, but an additional option for students trying to learn.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>I also believe there are many downsides with learning from home that students don't completely understand especially at a young age, you don't learn social skills and how to communicate your thoughts with peers which in primary/secondary I'd argue is more important than your grade.</em></h4><br>
<h4><em>I do think AI is a benefit to society, but with every new technology there are concerns to be aware of.</em></h4><br>
