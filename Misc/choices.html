<h1>Artifical Intelligence, and Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The role of Artificial Intelligence in education comes with many choices in relation to adopting the technology in the classroom. Education is a complex and fluid process, which comprises multiple goals and objectives - With Artificial Intelligence, there are many options that allow one to progress along this process.</p>


	
<p>The first option is a Supercomputer. Braiki et al. (2020), gives the example of the IBM Watson supercomputer. Named for IBM founder, Thomas J. Watson, Watson is a supercomputer that combines artificial intelligence and sophisticated analytical software to serve as a “question answering machine”. Watson provides advice and information relating to any queries given to them, on topics ranging from car parking, to submitting student assignments. Accessible from any place and at any time, Watson is a clear example of the results of integrated Artificial Intelligence in a University environment. Reportedly, Watson utilises a wide range of machine learning algorithms, where shallow and deep knowledge, like neural networks, are integrated by balancing the use of shallow and deep semantics.</p>

<p>While derivative and comprehensive, rather than innovative and revolutionary, the reduction of demands on administrative workforce, and its impacts of service regarding university students are evident.</p>
	
	

<p>As education progresses and new technology is engineered, the method that education is delivered has changed. Transitioning alongside this change, is the implementation of Artificial Intelligence. While supercomputers, such as the example given previously, are the most well known and popular image of artificial intelligence in education, the current method is web-based. The use of programs and automated bots to perform tasks such as test marking, or examination review are extremely prevalent. Due to this, teachers are more effective and efficient, and students receive a more personalized and richer education, as the tools allow them to learn within the context of their own abilities.</p>

<p>Chen, Chen and Lin (2020), state that “AI is no longer computers only or the desktop and other computer applications as conventionally understood.” This separation from desktop and computer notions is corroborated by Chassignol et al., who provides examples of different platforms and applications of Artificial Intelligence, such as Interactive learning environments (ILEs), which are used to manage performance and provide feedback and exchanges between teachers and students; Intelligent tutoring systems, such as ACTIVE Math, MATHia, Why2Atlas, Comet, and Viper which have been used at different levels of the education system by educators or instructors for different subjects, and has seen extensive use in learning assessment to track performance and improve the available pedagogical tools.</p>

<p>Web-based educational systems, or intelligent web-based education (IWBE), has steadily emerged as an important component in education powered by artificial intelligence, especially with the proliferation of online education.Peredo et al. posits that this has occurred because of the power of the platform as a pedagogical tool that incorporates and leverages AI into web-based education (WBE) well as other intelligent methods, tools, and theories for modelling engineering agent-based systems and technologies. IWBE, as shown by their findings, involves the consideration of the learner’s knowledge, skill, experience, and performance, leveraging those variables to provide a satisfactory learning experience.</p>

	
<p>These choices that are currently available in regards to integrating artificial intelligence in education show that Artificial intelligence is readily available, and has already been integrated into education. The choice between web-based or hardware based integrations is a simple one: The transition towards web-based applications indicates an increase in retention, satisfaction, as well as a greater level of accessibility.</p>
