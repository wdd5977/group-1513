<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>Artificial Intelligence is something that has and will continue to affect education, and the delivery of such. Already, web-based education has become prevalent, and is used as a tool by many educators, even our own Auckland University of Technology. The progress is inevitable, and while it is somewhat saddening to know that certain jobs and methods will be phased out, this is merely the result of progress. In terms of reccommendations, the progress and development of AI and its integration should be closely followed - Such things should have direction, and further development can only benefit students. Keeping this in mind, steps should be taken to ensure that the processes and the methodology do not end up isolating students, or removing the human element in the education system. Automation is useful, but cannot be allowed to supplant all aspects.</em></h4><br>
