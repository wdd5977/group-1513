<h1>How AI impacts Education in today's society</h1>

</ul><h3><p>The emerging prevalence of AI usage in today's education.<p></h3>
</ul><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of science that creates, and studies machines aimed at boosting human intelligence mechanisms.</p>
<p>The primary goal of AI is to improve the effectiveness and quality of core tasks. The number of companies adopting AI continues to rise around the world.</p>
<p>The widespread use of technology in education is changing the way people acquire knowledge. Artificial intelligence is one of the obstructive methods used to personalise the educational experiences of various learning groups, teachers, and tutors.</p>

<p>AI tools are applied to improve study processes through personalized education. Artificial intelligence assists in determining what a student knows and does not know, allowing for the creation of a personalised study schedule for each student based on knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>In this way, AI tailors’ studies to the precise needs of students, increasing their productivity.</p>

<p>Another tool used is through the production of smart content. It can be categorized into three different types. Firstly, digital lessons. It will contain interfaces with options to customize digital textbooks, lessons, study guides and much more throughout the years.</p>
<p>Secondly, information visualization. AI can power new ways of receiving information, such as visualisation, web-based study environments and simulation.</p>
<p>Lastly, learning content updates. Furthermore, Ai assists the generation and updating of learning activities, attempting to keep the records up to date and tailoring it to various learning curves.</p>

<p>AI in today’s education is everywhere, especially due to covid. Online learning, like most instructional practices, has advantages and disadvantages. Comprehending these advantages and disadvantages will aid the institute in implementing ideas for more efficiently delivering lectures and ensuring students have an undisturbed learning journey.</p>
<p>Online education has the advantage of allowing students to attend classes from any desired location. Online lectures can be filmed, archived, and shared for future reference. This offers students the course content at any time, which is efficient and convenient for them.</p>
<p>It is also economically viable, as many academic institutions conserve money because of it. It is also economically viable because many higher education institutions save funds because they do not need to use a physical classroom, resulting in lower budgetary spending.</p>
<p>Finally, it is eco-friendly because it does not contribute to the environmental damage caused by production of paper.</p>

<p>As there are many advantages to the society, there are also con’s. When it comes to studying at home, distractions are unavoidable. As it will be your own e-learning, you will need self-motivation as well as organizational skills to study while doing other things like household work or working part-time. Furthermore, because you no longer get to see your professors and schoolmates face to face, E-learning leads to a lack of social interactions.</p>
<p>The classroom in the future will mostly likely have the artificial intelligence provide personalized learning for every single student.</p>
