<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>My unique perspective on how AI impacts education.</em></h4><br>
</u1><h4><p>Whether students and academic institutions like it or not, artificial intelligence is progressively being used in institutions around the world, and it will have a significant effect on the development of tertiary education. Many of the most pressing ethical problems concerning AI and machine learning in general, and particularly in education, are AI bias, black box nature of AI systems, Digital human rights issues, deep fakes and the possibility of a lack of independent guidance for educational leaders making AI and ML decisions.<p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>Avoiding the use of AI-systems as a teacher and a student is the best option, but in today's world, as technology advances at a rapid pace, that is no longer an option. Personally, I believe that we should not allow AI to take over our education system, and that instead of fully compromising into e-learning, the traditional method of education should be offered to younger students. <p></h4>
