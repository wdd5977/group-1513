<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
</u1><h4><p>The involvement of technology in education has long been a major issue, sparking debates about how much screen time young children should have or how technology affects children's learning and development. AI has been rapidly becoming a reliable assistant in the school environment, from removing marking and other administrative work from teachers' plates to providing students with customised learning and teaching. This level of intelligence also comes with risk. We all end up leaving various information footprints, likely to result in a quantity of data that allows individual and societal behaviour to be objectively quantified and, as a result, quickly tracked, modelled, and, to some extent, predicted. <p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>There are a few types of risks that we need to consider when it comes to AI applications in education. Firstly, privacy, safety, and security. The significance of AI for kid's confidentiality, protection, and safety range from economic advantages such as the capacity to comprehend potential risks to kids with great clarity and accuracy than ever before to threat such as unintentional privacy violations. Identify protection is one of the key risks when it comes to security, such as financial protection and identity theft. Location detection and biological safety can also be included. <p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>Access to services inclusion and equitability. To avoid exclusionary consequences, we must be conscious, wary, and deliberate as we empower machines to make judgements about who is included within excluded from these types of critical opportunities. There is a significant risk that the uncontrolled use of AI/ Machine learning to decide who gets access to what services will enhance historical bias and protect children from having a fair chance in life.<p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>Livelihood and dignity/automation. While AI will introduce substantial benefits to our national and global economies, automation will change the outlook of possibilities for coming generations, particularly in the area of employment, in ways we cannot fully anticipate. Considered and intentional discoveries must be conducted to ensure that every child is capable of protecting their entitlement to a full and decent quality of life, in circumstances that ensure dignity, promote self-reliance, and enable a child's productive participation in society through employment, skilling, social opportunities and learning leisure. <p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>The new methods in which children and adolescents interact with technology have impacts on our human biology and psychology. We need to be aware of what AI would do to the brain of children. More specifically, What tends to happen when we delegate complex processes to AI, and what are the consequences of the global economy? What will the psychological implications be to our children? Such as lack of social skills, anxiety when faced with the real world and depression due to lack of social interaction? What would Cognitive manipulation be like towards our children? Will it manipulate or control the childrenâ€™s behaviour through the use of direct AI? There are many risks involved when it comes to AI in education. <p></h4>
</u1><h4><p>This computational process is very similar to how humans learn. It should be unsurprising that technological advancements are driving the use of artificial intelligence in education. AI-based systems can analyse massive amounts of data, and the use of artificial intelligence in schooling includes training, interaction, management, and management of resources.<p></h4>
